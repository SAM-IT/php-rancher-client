# WORK IN PROGRESS
This library is a work in progress, it is not in use in any production system.

##
The idea behind this API client is that it defines a minimal skeleton code which then generates the remaining code 
from the Rancher API itself.
For now i've included all the generated class in the repository to make inspection / reasoning about the generated code easier.
